network.py: contains our code for creating the neural network model with TF

training.py: contains our code for training the created network AND for visualizing results

attemptdynlayer.py: contains our (nonfunctional) code which attempted to allow flexible model creation with desired number of layers

plots (directory): contains the graphs of training and test performance (loss and accuracy) when the model is run with the standard settings and with the other settings we tried

Written Responses: contains our written responses for exercises requiring this
